# F1 Karvaan — Predictions League

## What this is
A React single-page app for running an F1 predictions league among friends. Players predict pole, race podium, sprint results, and a random-slot driver each race weekend. Points are scored on exact matches.

**Live app:** https://f1-predictionsleague.web.app  
**Firebase project:** f1-predictions-league  
**GitHub:** https://github.com/Davenick89/f1-league

## Tech stack
- **Frontend:** React 18, Vite 5, Tailwind (via CDN in index.html)
- **Database:** Firestore (Firebase)
- **Auth:** Firebase Auth (Google sign-in)
- **Backend:** Firebase Cloud Functions (Node 22) — `functions/index.js`
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting → `dist/` folder
- **Scoring engine:** `scoring.js` (imported by F1League.jsx)

## Key files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `F1League.jsx` | Entire frontend — ~4400 lines, single-file SPA |
| `scoring.js` | Canonical scoring engine — `scoreRace()`, `rfDistance()`, `rfPoints()` |
| `firestore.rules` | Security rules — all auth/lock logic lives here |
| `functions/index.js` | Cloud Functions — `autoLockRound`, scoring triggers |
| `validation.js` | Input validation helpers |
| `vite.config.js` | Vite config — dev server on port 5173 |
| `.claude/launch.json` | Dev server configs for Claude Code browser preview |

## Firestore collections
```
/users/{userId}                        — user profiles (own-doc read only)
/groups/{groupId}                      — league doc (members, admin, settings)
/groups/{groupId}/predictions/{userId} — per-user predictions (keyed by userId, not round)
/groups/{groupId}/scores/{userId}      — cumulative scores
/groups/{groupId}/results/{roundId}    — admin-entered race results
/groups/{groupId}/raceStatus/{roundId} — lock state, override window
/groups/{groupId}/randomNumbers/{roundId} — random slot number (immutable once set)
/groups/{groupId}/auditLog/{logId}     — prediction_submit / prediction_edit / admin_unlock
/groups/{groupId}/systemLogs/{logId}   — admin operation logs
/invites/{code}                        — invite links
```

## Prediction lock logic
- Default lock: **60 minutes before Qualifying** (or Sprint Qualifying on sprint weekends)
- Predictions open: **Monday 00:00 UTC of race week** — Save button disabled before this
- After lock: only admin can unlock via `handleUnlockPredictions()`
- Admin unlock opens a **15-minute override window** then auto-relocks
- `overrideExpiresAt` is a Firestore `Timestamp` — enforced server-side in `isRaceOpen()` via `request.time`

Key functions in F1League.jsx:
- `getPredictionLockTime(race, offsetMins, apiSessionStr)`
- `getPredictionOpenTime(race)` — returns Monday 00:00 UTC of race week
- `isEditLocked(race, offsetMins)`

---

## Scoring rules
- **Pole, Race P1/P2/P3, Sprint fields:** +1 for exact match
- **R# (random slot):** +2 exact position, +1 closest among all players, +0 otherwise
- **DNS / NC:** score 0 for R# (no official classified position)
- **DNF-but-classified:** scores normally at their official finishing position (≥90% race distance rule)
- Scoring engine: `scoreRace()` for exact fields, `rfDistance()` + `rfPoints()` for R#

---

## Audit log action types
- `prediction_submit` — first time a player saves predictions for a round
- `prediction_edit` — subsequent saves after predictions already exist
- `admin_unlock` — admin manually opened predictions post-lock

---

## Firestore Rules — critical constraint
**Rules functions cannot use `if` statements or multiple `return` statements.**  
Must be a single `return` expression chained with `&&` / `||` and optional `let` bindings.

```javascript
// WRONG — will not compile
function isRaceOpen(groupId) {
  if (!('currentOpenRound' in g)) return true;  // ❌
}

// CORRECT
function isRaceOpen(groupId) {
  let g = groupData(groupId);
  return !('currentOpenRound' in g) || (...);   // ✓
}
```

---

## Nickname reads — important pattern
`/users/{userId}` is restricted to own-doc reads only (security fix).  
All member nickname lookups across the app read from the **predictions document**, not the users document.  
Do not add new code that reads nicknames from `/users/{otherId}`.

## Deployment commands
```bash
# Frontend only
npm run build && firebase deploy --only hosting

# Rules only
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Cloud Functions only
firebase deploy --only functions

# Everything
npm run build && firebase deploy
```

---

## Dev server
```bash
npm run dev       # Vite dev server — http://localhost:5173 (hot reload)
npm run preview   # Serve production build locally — http://localhost:4173
```

## Multi-agent setup (Claude + Codex)
This project uses a two-agent workflow on the VPS:
- **Claude Code** — plans, architects, validates, deploys
- **Codex CLI** — executes bulk implementation when invoked by Claude Code via bash

Claude Code runs Codex as a subprocess (non-interactive, full-auto mode):
```bash
codex --approval-policy=full-auto "implement: [spec]"
```
Claude Code then reads the diff and validates/fixes the result.

## VPS dev environment
- **Host:** Firebird VPS (`vmi3099394`) — Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **User:** `controller`
- **Project path:** `~/f1-league`
- **tmux session:** `f1-league`
- **Node:** v20.20.2 (via nvm)
- **Firebase CLI:** v15.24.0

To reconnect from phone: SSH → `tmux attach -t f1-league` → `claude`
